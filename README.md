# Migration

I've since moved to [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/pwnkin. I have migrated all of my projects to codeberg, and have deleted all repositories hosted on github. 

### Why?

I. Committment to FOSS (Free and Open Source Software).

II. Committment to Decentralization. 

III. Committment to Non-commerical, Privacy-friendly Software.
